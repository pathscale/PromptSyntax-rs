# Working agreement

- Use stable Rust and keep `unsafe` forbidden.
- The parser is provenance-aware. Never turn inert, escaped, quoted, or fenced content
  into control-plane syntax.
- Bare references and actions are environment-relative and parse only when the caller
  declares them available. Qualified references may parse without a resolver.
- Preserve byte ranges and source text exactly. Parsing must not silently rewrite user
  input.
- Keep the Rust and TypeScript conformance cases behavior-compatible.
- Run formatting, tests, and strict Clippy before reporting completion.
- Do not publish or push without explicit approval.

## Git workflow

- **Always specify the branch when pushing**: `git push origin branch-name`
- **Branch naming**: `fix/issue-description` or `feat/issue-description`
- **Force-push your own branch freely.** Rebasing a feature branch onto a moved base, or
  amending before review, is normal and correct — use `--force-with-lease` so you don't
  clobber someone else's push.
- **Never force-push the default branch.** That is the history everyone
  else builds on, and it is protected server-side for a reason.
- **Never create merge commits — this is a hard ban.** Not locally, not to refresh a
  branch, not to land a pull request. If your branch has fallen behind, **rebase** it onto
  the moved base (`git rebase origin/master`, then `--force-with-lease`). `git merge master`
  into a feature branch is not an acceptable shortcut: it adds a commit whose only content
  is the fact that you were behind, and it turns a readable line of work into a diamond.
- **Rebase is the default everywhere** — refreshing a branch, and landing a pull request.
  Individual commits carry information: what was tried, in what order, and why. A rebase
  keeps that granularity on the base branch, so write commits worth keeping and land them
  intact.
- **Landing a pull request means rebase, then fast-forward.** `git rebase origin/master`
  on the branch, then `git merge --ff-only <branch>` on the base, then push. Those two
  commands are the whole job, so don't reach for `gh pr merge`: its default writes a
  merge commit. Rebasing rewrites the commit SHAs, so GitHub cannot always detect that
  a branch landed — close such pull requests explicitly and say why.
- **Don't delete remote branches by hand.** Once the work is on the default branch it is
  reaped automatically. Deleting your own local copy is fine.
- **Squash is acceptable** where it genuinely makes things easier or is the more
  appropriate shape for the branch — one logical change scattered across fixup commits, or
  a long branch whose intermediate states aren't worth preserving. It is a judgement call,
  not a violation. Merging is the only thing that is never allowed.
- **Delete what is deprecated.** A superseded file, flag, branch or code path gets removed
  in the change that supersedes it, not left behind with a deprecation note.
